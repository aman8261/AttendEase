# AttendEase
The Android Attendance System uses QR code scanning and GPS verification for accurate, location-based tracking. Students scan a QR code, and the app verifies their GPS coordinates to prevent proxy attendance. Admins can generate QR codes, set locations, and monitor records in real-time using Android Studio, Google Maps API, Firebase/SQLite.
